1. General overview of BEAGLE

BEAGLE is a high-performance library that can perform the core calculations at the heart of most Bayesian
and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics packages. It can make use of highly-parallel processors such as those
in graphics cards (GPUs) found in many PCs.

The project involves an open API and fast implementations of a library for evaluating phylogenetic
likelihoods (continuous time Markov processes) of biomolecular sequence evolution.

The aim is to provide high performance evaluation ‘services’ to a wide range of phylogenetic software,
both Bayesian samplers and Maximum Likelihood optimizers. This allows these packages to make use of
implementations that make use of optimized hardware such as graphics processing units.

2. Compilation instructions

Quick and dirty instructions on how to compile and install the BEAGLE library from the git repository 'master':

      $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib.git
      $ cd beagle-lib
      $ ./autogen.sh
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ sudo make install

Remarks:

When compiling in the MacOS Unix environment ("Terminal"), you need to install the autotools first. They are no
longer shipped with Xcode. you need to obtain the following software packages: autoconf, automake, and libtool.
The easiest way to install these is with the Homebrew package manager (http://brew.sh/). Open 'Terminal.app'
and paste the installation command from the Homebrew website (you will find it at the top of the page, under
Install Homebrew). Next enter the following to install the required packages:

      $ brew install libtool autoconf automake
